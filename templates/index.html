            OSPF, or Open Shortest Path First, is a dynamic routing protocol used in computer networks to determine the
            best path for routing IP packets. It is a link state
            routing protocol that uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest
            path between two nodes. This simulation will show you how the
            algorithm works and how it finds the shortest path between two nodes.

            OSPF is a versatile routing protocol that is used in various network environments such as enterprise
            networks, data centers, ISPs, campus networks, and Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). In enterprise networks,
            OSPF allows for smooth communication between different departments or branches. ISPs rely on OSPF to manage
            routing within their networks and ensure stable internet connectivity. In data centers, OSPF facilitates
            routing between network devices and servers. For large campus networks, OSPF guarantees connectivity between
            multiple buildings or locations. In IXPs, OSPF optimizes routing for efficient exchange of internet traffic
            between networks. Overall, OSPF's dynamic routing capabilities make it an important tool for efficient and
            reliable routing within autonomous systems across diverse network settings.

            OSPF's link-state algorithm utilizes detailed network topology information to make accurate and efficient
            routing decisions, resulting in faster convergence and better adaptation to network changes. Its
            hierarchical design makes it scalable by dividing large networks into smaller areas, reducing the routing
            information each router needs to process. OSPF also supports load balancing across multiple paths,
            optimizing network resource utilization. In addition, OSPF provides robust security features, including
            authentication mechanisms, to protect against unauthorized access and ensure the integrity of routing
            updates. Overall, OSPF is a dependable and secure choice for dynamic, scalable, and efficient routing within
            autonomous systems.

            My program takes the user inputted number, and creates that many routers based on the number the user put
            in. Each router is then connected to each other and is assigned a weight. This weight determines the path
            the router will take to get to the destination router. The program then runs Dijkstra's algorithm to find
            the shortest path between the two routers. The program will draw a line showing the path the packet will
            take. The program will then write this to a HTML file to displayed to the user.
